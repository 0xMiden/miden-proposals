# Miden proposals

This repository contains proposals for the Miden protocol:
- Miden RFPs: Miden Requests For Proposals
- Miden RFCs: Miden Requests For Comments

## Miden RFPs

Miden Requests For Proposals are documents that outline specific problems or features the Miden protocol needs solved. They represent areas where the Miden team is actively seeking external contributions or solutions. RFPs define scope, requirements, desired outcomes, and include information about potential compensation for successful proposals. They are a way for the Miden ecosystem to publicly communicate its priorities and invite the broader community to contribute solutions to specific challenges.

### Submission

To submit a Miden Request for Proposal please email your proposal to [hello@miden.team](mailto:hello@miden.team). 

## Miden RFCs

Miden Requests For Comments are formal technical documents proposing standards, enhancements, or architectural changes to the Miden protocol. Each RFC provides detailed specifications including motivation, technical details, implementation guidance, security considerations, and backward compatibility analysis. They serve as both documentation and a mechanism for achieving consensus through community review and discussion. RFCs follow a structured process from draft to final status, creating a transparent record of design decisions and establishing the technical foundation for Miden's ongoing development.
